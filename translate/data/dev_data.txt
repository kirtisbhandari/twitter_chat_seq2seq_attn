seriously, hillary? last i checked we have a black president &amp; a black doj head. maybe you should talk to them... 😒
what if black cops were killing white men? where is your outrage?
canada has just as much grit. the difference is when you have skill they don't refer your team as having grit.

what are your thoughts on jerry rice defending kaepernick?
rethought his position. certainly kaep's decision 2 kneel instead of sitting after talking 2 a military member may have helped
i think it is stupid if the patriots try and rush garrapolo back by telling him what tom brady has and hasn't played with.
well, it depends. what's garoppolo's true concern? that he won't be effective with his arm in pain? that it'll aggravate?
he brought the boom! 💥 (via trethatruth__/instagram)

that said, there are 2 ways you can run things: 1) give up control (eg adi) or 2) give exceedingly clear direction. nike is waffling (lol).

trump sought advice from his golf buddy bill before deciding to run. the clintons attended trump's wedding. our campaign isn't the problem.

what are your thoughts on jerry rice defending kaepernick?
ultimately i wonder what is the true in rice's heart, a lot of pressure was put on him to change his position and fall in line
definitely bro i think this is very similar to the 2010 class with dion waitets cj fair and fab melo let's hope!
white, thompson, lydon, roberson, battle; lot of length and athleticism
trouble finding a class to mystery skype with. help!! in us, 3rd grade, want to guess closest major city.
i'm 3rd grade in southern ca! let's do it!
i'm not going to let this ceremony break my tradition of watching the berlin marathon in new york city

complaint: ahmad rahami bought bomb-making equipment on ebay, had them delivered to nj business where he worked…
interesting, \a muslin who had a rhinoplasty but not heart value replacement.
and joel would know. coming from the guy who translated the dark forest, you should heed his warning!
everyone should be prepared!
watching brett hull undress torts and his coaching is easing the pain watching this.
somewhere, phil kessel and bobby ryan are smiling
and you get to get a new iphone every hardware cycle instead of every other.
all true. but no one does 2 year contracts anymore. it's all monthly spread out payments now.
what are your thoughts on jerry rice defending kaepernick?
with his community.
smart contracts, in particular, require a very special kind of developer.
terminal chokepoint(and also "picks &amp; shovels" oppty) of smart contracts is hardened data sources; nobody has a clue how to solve it.
advantages: reasonable access to fidi, minimal new construction in sf, feeds all current bart lines, no sea level issues
main issue is 50% loss of highway capacity. political non-starter (for now). making bus lane in both directions more possible.
if you know what pt said after the prosecutors presented the case against lula and the other 8, you know what this guy spoke
yup. i know. so again...his info on top of pt info is no new info. just noise.

topic: has the next american woman to win a worlds or olympic medal run a marathon yet?
my lifelong spurs fan of a grandad died early this morning. so close to him but hopefully he's in a better place now. rip

i don't read or listen to political talking points, this way i don't repeat them sem querer.
so you leave the store, and directly outside are people selling chinese knock-off cases from the back of a van.

the info in the tweet above is why trump is beating clinton. the 1% is riding roughshod over the 99%. b4 its too late.
it was too late when hillary rigged the primaries with help of msm. no hope for clinton being replaced, sadly.
the patriots are despicable.
all teams do this.

very strange how little classism i used to see. i mistook opportunity afforded to me as opportunity afforded to everyone
a vote for stein or johnson is a vote for trump &amp; there is something really wrong with electing trump.trumps pro fracking.

oh i was in shock when i finally read "mere christianity". though in a good way as i was beginning my exit from evangelicalism.
his writings nurtured my increasingly progressive evangelicalism. re-reading the bible and regular prayer showed me the exit.

i just turned a horrible negative mood into a positive productive thing and that's such a good feeling.
although i did write my most angry and personal hardcore song ever so that was kinda cool too
took me engaging in modern day imperialism to open my eyes and look at what it's like where i live
land of the free and home of the brave. i'm so lucky that i get to see myself in that. and finally can see that others don't.
we are in love!

agreed! but i feel at some point the figures will unionize. the pay they get is a joke.
the more money ufc draws, the more confident they'll be in doing what they want. this puts more pressure on fighters
more interesting to me is why hrc or any dem/lib isnt crushing it rn. because the opportunity is there
people think she's just as dishonest and a national security risk.

trump used more than a quarter-million dollars from his charity to settle legal problems:
trump = the grift that keeps on grifting.

sean hannity in trouble at fox after participating in trump ad:
there are three things i love about that gif.. 1 is the prancing, 2nd is the suit and 3rd is... what was the third again?
more interesting to me is why hrc or any dem/lib isnt crushing it rn. because the opportunity is there
not sure why the fact that trump could appoint up to 3 ultra conservative supreme court justices isn't a bigger deal
right!? hopefully someone does or just bring jelaminah back to teach her a lesson
i literally tweeted her and was like "let her know!"
pretty sure i'm gonna start crying pretty soon and i don't have time for that rn bc i have more important things to do smh
i just cried enough for the both of us. u good fam.
say u don't like her but try not to talk shit about the wonderful thing she did in becoming a parent to children who needed it
that's actually a great compromise. i will tweet this exact thing.
ny's response to terror was cool and almost indifferent—which means rational and inspiring.

he then failed to make a break to cover second for possible force on lineout to 3b. not his finest moment. still young, still learning 2b.
i'm sure pedroia and or bogey may say something
my prediction: trump will make awful, indefensible and false statements during the debate. and then he will double down on them afterwards.
you called it!
thank you nevada!
let's make america great again!
truth. they don't fear black, muslim, latino, immigrant or lgbtq americans. they want them segregated, oppressed &amp;…
they really dont fear these souls. white supremacy is based on power *over* these souls. it's the mother of racism.

yeah and i had to park like way over by cold stone
agreed! but i feel at some point the figures will unionize. the pay they get is a joke.
i don't think they'll unionize. ufc is their only platform, they can't make more money elsewhere. they'd be stuck tbh.

i mean let's be honest.. if i'm asking u to do something a diff way than how you're doing it.. it's cause of how i got it in the past right?
yes, it's a given. but we're all adults, u should be able to say how u like something done w/o attitude. we all have preferences.

if a young, black pitcher behaved like that, invited confrontation, he wouldn't be lauded as "country strong." he'd be labeled a thug.
i'll say it...bum acted like a thug....a fake one albeit.
i have heard many, many veterans say this. and their spouses/partners, too.
all we think about "over there" is what we'll do when we get home. dream too big. you get back. you flop. you're in deep ca-ca!
tennistv is a good enough product that they could have raised the price for an annual subscription next year, and i would have bought it.

donald trump brags about using "other people's money" amid questions over his charity use
