no, i don't think so. katie holmes, james van der beek, michelle williams, josh jackson...

and to get back to my original point about the variety obit: i do not care if river wild was "derivative," it's a fucking fantastic movie.
again, this is because evidence of wrongdoing around her has a tendency to vanish or get ignored.
i'm sure you'd agree that also, as well, she gets accused of lots of insane bullshit that she didn't, in fact, do.
la is good to me too honestly. lmk if you ever get to the twin cities tho
im a biased mid westerner. cheers m8
oddly, it is clinton who has stated that she would destroy my livelihood (to please a big donor) while trump would save it.
if you think that trump would do anything for anybody but himself, you are living in dreamland. trump is a con man &amp; a criminal.

trump campaign “responds” to story by attacking him.
trump is so full of it! his lies are so natural.
you should do an astrology thread! — what kind of thread!
like specifics i mean ...
i was lagging
lmao dude my bro a bad vibe bringing us down
i'm trying. it better spark intense heat, debate &amp;change. not saying it won't happen again but this darkness got to give
it will be brushed under the rug on mainstream media by some stupid trump comment by monday.
it's not enough for trump to lose the election. his brand needs to tank, his empire must crumble, and he needs to starve in a gutter
it will be a landslide win
im ignorant on jasta-u know 2 much, sir!

i have no doubt i would much prefer the news in another state. glad to hear it's just la that's broken &amp; not all of ca.
entertainment is the major industry in l.a. some don't realize that when they complain about celebrity news in local news.
your mom literally bought me one of these
are my feelings rooted in jealousy? perhaps it is because i wouldn't feel confident with my fat neck
you clearly did what? you jumped into my mentions all asshurt because little girl jill is going to lose 😂😂

oh okay out friendship has passed yet another test
lmfao i'm glad. it would be so sad to see it end 😔.
but bc alarms go off so frequently for small reasons, the amount of serious attention that they receive is very slim
i'd venture to guess that most ppl hear an alarm and think "annoyance" rather than "emergency"
duh ... people be like i hate high school im like blood what? i had hella fun especially cause i was all the older kids 😂
exactly, high school was dumbass fun, you just had to be around the right people

trump is the liberal msm's idea of a fascist. if you fall for this, the lefty joke is on you.

i get this weird feeling that when airbnb's co-founders say refugees , they mean anywhere the hell away from them.
and a video or direct quote of clinton saying she wants to abolish the 2nd amendment.
conspiracy theories. he's insane.
but hillary accepts millions from countries who suppress woman, kill homosexulas etc.
a lot more than trump.
can we just have another dnc? there's no rule against that, right?
scariest part is the bounce back. if trump times one of those right before nov 8, he could win.

lol you're right i guess that's true!
about what sorry i got a lot of mentions right now lol
i know it's annoying to keep hearing this but the show is so damn good. s4 and 5 are exceptional.
it's also the best argument for serialized television drama. one cohesive story with a well-defined beginning, middle, and end.
i remember when saying they wanted you from ages ago. take gs by storm, my friend ✊🏽
what? i have no recollection of such statements.
more than 50% of americans own stock in corporations. check these facts for yourself

you know nothing of the clinton foundation. and virtually all campaign contributions are legal now.
legal doesn't mean they're not suspect. citizens united is law of land, aren't u supposed to be against it? ugh.
all the while, i'm trying to find where i can get an apple leather case by the weekend without driving 1.5 hours.

we've already established the basement loser is you, and reuters poolls everybody. nice try.
why do you get a detention for one tardy. odowd sucks
duude tomorrow after school? same. odowd is such a joke lmao
you have proof he lynched anyone? and you can stick a sock in your stupid smears.
byrd was born into the kkk. he was an exhalted cyclops, of course he lynched blacks. wake up!
i told you ! it's super obvious he did it
3. if he was found guilty shame would of been brought to the family name &amp; he would have went to jail for sure
i believe that hillary clinton does in fact care about people and communities. her life hasn't been easy. she is flawed for sure. so are we.
speak for yourself.
hey y'all, lives in nyc now and all is right with the world. 🙌🏼💃🏻🍷😄👏🏼❤️👊🏼🎉🏡🍜🏙👯

he was wearing underwear- we saw the raw in edit version🙄
there are so many provably false statements here
lie after lie after lie. if they're not white supremacists and deplorable people, just how stupid are trump's supporters?!

wouldn't call myself a circle but my roommate did mention her work like 2 days ago and i complained abt her website lol
huh? that was 20 years ago. you do know that 2015 was officially the hottest year on record since 1880?…
back in may, scientists were already predicting a 99% chance that this year will be hotter than 2015.
we remember...

i guessed this before. i want it noted.
ugh, i did as well. i don't know if i'm pleased with myself or just disappointed with the show.

i'm not a trump supporter but if you can't read that as a plain denial then you're losing objectivity, imho.

thanks to you
when i'm back home i'll make some and make it all😍✊🏼

it gets tiring when the media won't call out trump for this overtly racist, multi-year, disqualifying action
mark the media call trump out every waking hour, even from the right (eg ). maybe time to consider why voters despise hrc et al

“entrepreneurship is a calling not a job” by
couldn't agree more!
1)a few, possibly ill-advised thoughts, on my way home from an avett brothers show.

which urban actor is under this costume?
martin lawrence

why not learn or find out others perspective.
i have, the muslim perspective is barbarity and forced dominance. you deserve no respect.
3)some were bands i was dying to see. others were just part of my job. all were better than sitting on my couch watching netflix.
4)but even the best sets had moments that left me cold, where the hand clapping sing alongs felt false.

congratulations, it's a big step :)
4)but even the best sets had moments that left me cold, where the hand clapping sing alongs felt false.
5) &amp; those moments made me realize what i treasure about music is its ability to pierce my frozen wasp-y heart and make me feel something.
great to hear. what sort of cocktails do you usually go for? more on the fruity side?
well i'm a bartender so i like all kinds of drinks! whisky and gin drinks are my favorite!
heavy breathing in spanish
(disapproving glare in spanish)
5) &amp; those moments made me realize what i treasure about music is its ability to pierce my frozen wasp-y heart and make me feel something.

freshmen ➡️ senior year 💞 definition of a day 1 😽😽
talk about our glo up tho
i just finished ep 19, but i don't think i would've been able to make it this far without the power of 2-4x speed viewing, haha
the worst p.a. works show before this imo was glasslip, but even that was a contained trainwreck in that it knew its genre
tomorrow's the first time in 9 years i won't get the new iphone on launch day been something of a tradition it's petty, but a bit bummed 😕
scratch that...first time in 10 years. 2007-2016
. where the answer to falling victim to the evil folly of others? the gain is singular, not unto the foolish, or the rich.
s'cusi. pearls to swine
6)but they also let me imagine an alternate reality, or possible future, when i felt nothing, even as everyone around me danced.
7)and that was terrifying. i do not suffer from clinical depression, and hope i’m not minimizing it by wondering if that’s what it’s like.
il mio lago. thi is limone at sunset, a beautiful place on lake garda ( benacus ) italy
absolutely beautiful alberto. have a wonderful friday
just a heads up next under 21 open mic coming up on september 30th in sf details to come ✨✨
will you be there? :)
except it is absolutely false:
1/2) not to act troll-like, but politico redefines meaning "to include birth certificate request"
damn :/ i did wanna try to go on another day, but didn't have money to buy them when they first went on sale.
it's fine it will still be fun
so you rave now lol 😉
bruh lol the life chose me
so sweet that jimmy fallon is having fun with a racist piece of human garbage.
does this look like a racist piece of human garbage? of course not.
she is going through shit and she hates herself so gay
i dont give a shit, if you ask for my opinion, im not going to sugarcoat it
come here on a thursday! r&amp;b and hip hop night
i was there last thursday ! + their fish bowls😍
9 obama executive orders cost taxpayers $31 billion and if she is elected she will make him look like an amateur
barry's executive orders are written by his handlers. soros, etc. his time is spent campaigning for crooked hillary and money
7)and that was terrifying. i do not suffer from clinical depression, and hope i’m not minimizing it by wondering if that’s what it’s like.
8)because if it is even slightly close to what it’s like, then…fuuuuccckkk.
also checkout they may have some in sf if you're on at&amp;t.
eh already preordered on launch night. just not delivering till first week of october.
sorry i don't know the exact right path to take in this dungeon, i'll think about my inadequacy while i wait for the daily lockout to clear

i'm not even about the races 😂 but leo always wants to race :(
well you building your car like one so that's the impression you giving lol
8)because if it is even slightly close to what it’s like, then…fuuuuccckkk.
9)i was born without faith. i don’t believe in god, or an afterlife. the only transcendence i’ve ever felt is at shows, or in headphones.
snowden lied and acted out of pique, house report charges
why didn't he leak russian secrets! wait🤔 putin would kill him.
1/2) not to act troll-like, but politico redefines meaning "to include birth certificate request"
2/2) per , '07 clinton chief strategist, memo issued 2 top surrogates 2 create innuendo
so my daughter wants to go thrifting for her birthday
u already kno the right thing to do.
9)i was born without faith. i don’t believe in god, or an afterlife. the only transcendence i’ve ever felt is at shows, or in headphones.
10)so, the possibility of that communion suddenly feeling empty horrifies me.
don't normally respond to these but this is so out of context &amp; unfair. what aired b4 &amp; after are important.
i agree with ! what is wrong with ?! you have been losing viewers because of crap just like this! he's !
the worst p.a. works show before this imo was glasslip, but even that was a contained trainwreck in that it knew its genre
with kuromukuro, there's such a loose form of story telling that we've got the misadventures of a side character trying to
i got this, too. i thought i was special.
jaime i thought we were special snapchat friends
seen anyone smelling their own fart?
just me. it's just like they described it though. boring &amp; stuck up. can't even buy tabs anywhere
with kuromukuro, there's such a loose form of story telling that we've got the misadventures of a side character trying to
become a cosplay net celebrity inordinately outweighing its convoluted sci-fi alien threat plot
10)so, the possibility of that communion suddenly feeling empty horrifies me.
11)and i realized that’s why i have zero patience for bands that waste my time. and why i love the bands i do beyond reason.
is anything grosser than being cutesy with trump? he's an anti-semite and virulent racist, so let's ruffle his hair.
of course hes none of those things, look at that adorable face
lmao god i'm bad at numbers yeah i'll bet anything it was in mb
. ok i don't have to sit around guessing, i have the source code here. let me load android studio &amp; find out for you.
need to be in a better mood 😞
cheer up buttercup
11)and i realized that’s why i have zero patience for bands that waste my time. and why i love the bands i do beyond reason.
12)final note, for anyone on or near the west coast: go to pappy and harriet’s on 9/21 to see the mekons.
you really have to learn how to love yourself before you can love someone else
i feel like some people jump into relationships and then realize they can't love their partner bc they struggle with loving themselves
i'll get to it. don't worry. lol.
i'm about as worried about you finishing a book as you finishing a tv show... never gonna happen

12)final note, for anyone on or near the west coast: go to pappy and harriet’s on 9/21 to see the mekons.
13)i have seen a gajillion bands. none more reliably tread the line between absurdity and brilliance like the mekons.
i know but you actually didnt rate you just stated an opinion when you dontknow whats happening
i said she was not attractive to me because she was clearly begging for attention by claiming she was ugly
again it show your ignorance and that you don't know arabic 4:89 is about fighting ( ideologies ) of disbelievers
come and try it. lets see how muslim you are....
hmmm. you turned on notifications on my tweets??😍😍 heheh
i thought i just added you to my favorites...maybe thats what i did instead lol.

her new ones are better and kyshadow changed my life😍
become a cosplay net celebrity inordinately outweighing its convoluted sci-fi alien threat plot
the female protag has also gotten superbly annoying to me in how meek, pouty, and powerless she is-
13)i have seen a gajillion bands. none more reliably tread the line between absurdity and brilliance like the mekons.
14)see the mekons in the desert while you still can. you might just see god. 15)thus endeth this lesson.
i said she was not attractive to me because she was clearly begging for attention by claiming she was ugly
im ugly as a foot and i act like hot shit because of confidence
the female protag has also gotten superbly annoying to me in how meek, pouty, and powerless she is-
definitely pales in comparison to the stories of growth for female leads in other p.a. works productions////

easy, his attorney general breaks the law as well.
who cares. look at apo, no one gives a crap about him anymore. he will just rot in prison. murderers need to be behind bars.
i agree but it was different with apo as the head of pkk terror group. they think slimeball demirtas is a freedom fighter.
especially since it seemed to start happening after i replaced the original hdd with a smaller ssd. the 250gb samsung is working great.
i even downloaded the latest firmware updater from the samsung site (the bootable iso, which i burned to a real dvd+r).
brazilian sources even suggest a €60m bid planned by barca for marquinhos in january. psg, as usual, has no intention of letting him go.
yah we dont have luiz anymore no way wecan drop marquinhos

mt : benghazi victims' parents sue hillary clinton

i was about to write a horrific/accurate detroit-related response. but censoring self.
censoring ends november 8th. ann was on gavin's show today. said check ur column for jokes not used. others besides spade plugs?
i demand angela makes her return, we need our needless garbage before digimon, we also need dated songs, and a rap
you don't want angela anaconda back. you think you do. but honestly. you don't.
le parisien have gone with hatem ben arfa being dropped as their main focus, saying it is no longer an affront to the player but a slap.
he's not disciplined enough?
just handwritten letters things❤️
believe me, they will come back as a luxury soon!
msm is being suckered into chasing birther stories. force trump to respond to questions he cant answer rather than those he won't answer
yes. who cares what he has to say about obama? where are the tax returns? release pre-2014 returns. show proof of audit now.
one last thing ima louisville fan. i root for my team then the acc. u never stated ur team tho?

like y'all know how desperate &amp; in need of validation y'all look like you need? y'all ain't celebrities, aint noone trying to keep up w/ you
remember, nothing is *ever* her fault. it's the media's fault. bernie's fault. bill's fault. the intelligence community's fault. never her.

actually, i think it's been since '98 😎🤘🏼
not fooled but you are. challenge your belief read and talk to people other than those who support your narrative.
you should take your own advice. you're lacking in common sense and intellect. stop deflecting &amp; projecting. it's sad.
literally hate how ios 10 looks 😑

i don’t count as a pundit but i meet the other criteria. knowing how to program can mean credibility with tech clients.
overkill to "learn how to code" for that reason. cs101 and a primer in open source licenses would be sufficient.

eight. you mean eight. i hope.
who cares. look at apo, no one gives a crap about him anymore. he will just rot in prison. murderers need to be behind bars.
. a friend in told me if you wanna be a strong country ignore the criticism and what anyone says. he is probably right.
i follow someone w/ a really similar icon to mine and whenever they tweet im like "what the fuck!! i didnt say that!!"
maybe i should change my icon 2 kinoto...
bad idea written all over it
used to have a '68 celica!
wow, are these all new college grads?
nah. i guess i should say "gave it up as a requirement" not as an expectation. it's still fairly common.
then stop selling it as fuck buddies to someone who isn't comfortable with just that lol
he's probably looking for some longevity. you don't have to get married but that can be ya boo

does it trip you out that no one ever found the zodiac killer? because it really freaks me out
and how someone profiled him to be a black man and the police potentially saw him and didn't suspect him bc he was white??
if you live in california go look at the moon!! it's not gold this time but it's still super duper pretty!!
keep in mind the only reason the moon changes its color is because of all the pollution 😂 if it's not white than you know why lol
jimmy fallon is cancelled for me. when you help make a dangerous individual likeable, you do politics, like it or not
fallon didn't help make trump likeable, trump is likeable all on his own
was reading pedantic nerd argument and one nerd said if he was wrong he'd donate money to a charity of the other's choosing
the other agreed but "my charity of choice is the us treasury"

touche', joe, touche'.
colleen yelled at me today and threw a crumbled paper at me lmao she was heat

trump did everyone a favor. he forced obama to release his birth certificate &amp; end the rumors.
but trump still won't give up on this idea. is he afraid of alienating some hard-core racists in his coalition?
i dont draw any of my furries w glasses anymore i wonder what that means
(that theyre cuter w/o them lmao fdkgmfdkgh i dont rock glasses very well but...i look like hope w/o them so. suffers)
that picture of obama looking like a muslim was leaked by her campaign.
its a little murky, but i think that you are right on this one.
jimmy fallon fails us all due to self absorption yet again
wtf did you want jimmy fallon to do?
teach me your secrets
omg. it was just transcribing. not like actual original ideas. that would be insane.

people are complaining about jimmy fallon like talk shows are real and not just for promoting shit at all. they're 99% staged guys.
they thought this was larry king live
so, i’m totally grokking the difference, and obv see the value in explicit (ie. let vs. var) - always in favor of being explicit

a couple of setbacks this year but -
watching videos of beyonce's work ethic, especially as a virgo, is so motivating to snatch it together.
when i downgraded, i had to dredge up the old ics image from the downloads folder of a laptop i got in 2010
ah ok. so it could be a lot of kernel issues. that's a big problem with cyanogenmod on non-developer devices.
what's the best height and weight this year for a center?
go with the stretcher or glass cleaner
until minecraft came along. kids growing up *will* start building houses using interchangeable blocks.
. it's possible, but a radical change from how building is done today in industrialized countries
ah ok. so it could be a lot of kernel issues. that's a big problem with cyanogenmod on non-developer devices.
sometimes people overclock their kernels and their phones crash all the time because of that. or just bugs in the throttling.

the media has gone soft on trump? what planet are you guys living on?
do you really believe that the us tightening immigration policy will cause other countries to stop trading with us? you seriously..
there are a ton of nations whose populations aren’t white who won’t want to deal with the us. especially if there is an option
. …it's really unfortunate because the 2013 moto g looks like it had a similar type of snapdragon chip as the earlier nexus 4.

or hes smart enough not to fall for the propaganda about trump
is committed to &amp; risk-reduction in the euro-atlantic area:
he talks a lot, but people are still dying in the russian aggressions.
hm… the right set of circumstances can bring about untold options. look at the patriot act, the rescission to invade was …

successful in the global business world by being a raging racist? he has proven that he can put those issues aside
i don’t know if i would call 6 bankruptcies successful. you look at his failed businesses schemes the scary trump university
so this dress falls perfectly into place after that but do u kno how much of a pain it was i think not
this is so cute i can't 😭😭😭
why are people so mad at jimmy fallon? the problem isn't that trump is on tv, it's that he's a presidential candidate.
i cant wait till he stops being a candidate and becomes president already
i don’t know if i would call 6 bankruptcies successful. you look at his failed businesses schemes the scary trump university
if that’s what you call successful then this is a pointless discussion.
trump's entire campaign is based on hatred of women and minorities. xenophobic, bigoted, and racist. very disappointed in jimmy fallon.
ll you really believe all that stuff? i thought bernies were smarter than that
please explain to me the logistics of any potus creating a nazi regime in the united states.

why wouldnt he like trump? trump is an adorable deplorable
i could flip this argument saying the second amendmentcould be scrapped by the same argument. but that’s a totally separate
argument. but here is the thing, you still haven’t made an argument as to what good a racist president would do?

the only "irrelevant crap" around here is your bitch ass. you talk about sf more than your raiders.

keith, jamesyboy, dope
ok i am worried 'big' 'bigoted' 'orange' ''4 yr old' how old are you? maybe to much sun when flying that kite.

the only "irrelevant crap" around here is your bitch ass. you talk about sf more than your raiders.
btw how am i in denial, i am asking you to bet w/ me on the season but you're afraid, its pointless cuz you hide ur identity
my industry is just a vast, ridiculous diaspora of hungry souls fighting for moments. even so, fuck jimmy fallon.
why you hatin?
now that's an awesome mom! ;) see you soon
seeing you guys will be the best thanksgiving everrr
just been chillin. quietly in love. staying outta trouble. protecting my relationship. then the lies hit &amp; i'm like

just an fyi we're not apart of the meet and greet, but we will be hanging out after every show by the merch booth. we want to meet you! :)
that's so dope love how that hasn't changed
how? by 'winning'? someone press this guy on specifics, looking at you debate moderators and hc. worst election ever
wear your knee boots- the b.s. is getting deeper every time trump makes a political promise.
. this is just for
"i jumped in front of a bus and didn't get hit. i'm a genius!"
jimmy fallon has always been a piece of shit to me, i'm not surprised.
why the hate on fallon and trump? it was a great show
. really fucked us on iphone 7 launch. so many lies, misinformation, mistakes from customer care &amp; the retail stores.
i’ve been mostly happy with but the iphone 7 pre-order/upgrade process with “jump” was awful. phone or in-store only…
i didn't want her to leave!

jimmy fallon was never down with the team. why are people surprised he was kissing trumps ring? surrounded himself with good people is all.
down with what team?
so, you should write drunk, edit sober, right? asking for a friend.
according to hemingway it's "write drunk and find a sober editor". not that i'm volunteering.
i hear you, chris. and i am disappointed you didn't experience our on-time operations. i know how frustrating that can be. ^cb
. afair this the 3rd flight in a row to be 1hr+ late.
today, i voted to put an end to the president’s plans to transfer known terrorists who want to do harm to americans
hey, brainiac, that's not what you voted for
all jimmy fallon had to do was ask about donald trumps rape case to donald himself but he just humored the child rapist for money &amp; ratings.
your fake rumor spreading tactics suck and are very outdated
talked w customer care &amp; retail all week &amp; even had cc hang up on me. a year after switching &amp; still no etf refunds. $700+ gone
oh yuck, they never paid your switch etf refund?!

it was the most beautiful moment on tv in the last 20 years
and they look fine until you add more than two ip addresses then big scrollbars make it so you can only see one.

i should qualify; saying "no" when it really, really matters. unless you are irreplaceable, leader or can walk away.
